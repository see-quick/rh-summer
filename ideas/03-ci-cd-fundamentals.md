# Session: CI/CD with GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines

## Objective:
Learn the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) by setting up pipelines using GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines for a sample application.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **GitHub Account:** For setting up GitHub Actions.
- **Azure DevOps Account:** For Azure Pipelines.
- **Sample Application:** A simple application (e.g., a web app) stored in a GitHub repository. Preferably something with unit tests already in place.

## Mini-Lecture Topics:

### 1. Introduction to CI/CD:
- Explain the concepts of Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment, and Continuous Delivery.
- Discuss the benefits of CI/CD for software development and deployment efficiency.

### 2. Overview of GitHub Actions:
- Introduction to GitHub Actions, including workflows, actions, runners, and events.
- Demonstrate how to set up a basic CI workflow to build and test a software project.

### 3. Overview of Azure Pipelines:
- Explain what Azure Pipelines is and its components (pipelines, tasks, agents).
- Show how to configure a build and release pipeline for a project in Azure DevOps.

## Coding Activity:

### Setting Up CI/CD with GitHub Actions:
1. **Create a Workflow File:**
    - Navigate to your project's repository on GitHub and create a new workflow under `.github/workflows`.
    - Define a simple workflow that checks out the code, installs dependencies, runs tests, and builds the application.

2. **Test the Workflow:**
    - Make a commit to trigger the workflow.
    - Review the execution details on GitHub to ensure the build and test steps complete successfully.

### Setting Up CI/CD with Azure Pipelines:
1. **Create a New Pipeline:**
    - Go to Azure DevOps, select your project, and navigate to Pipelines.
    - Connect your GitHub repository and define a pipeline using the YAML syntax. Include steps to build, test, and deploy your application.

2. **Run and Monitor the Pipeline:**
    - Trigger the pipeline by making a change in your repository.
    - Observe the pipeline execution in Azure DevOps, checking each step for successful completion.

## Wrap-Up and Discussion:

- **Comparing GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines:**
    - Discuss the similarities and differences between GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines, focusing on use cases, ease of setup, and integration capabilities.

- **Best Practices for CI/CD:**
    - Cover best practices for maintaining CI/CD pipelines, including managing secrets, using cache to speed up builds, and setting up notifications for build outcomes.

- **Q&A:**
    - Open the floor for questions, encouraging participants to share their experiences or concerns with CI/CD.

## Homework/Extension Activities:

- **Experiment with Advanced Features:**
    - Encourage participants to explore more advanced features such as deploying to different environments (staging, production) with manual approvals, using matrix builds for testing across multiple environments, or integrating static code analysis tools.

- **Personal Project CI/CD:**
    - Assign participants to implement CI/CD pipelines for their personal or team projects, applying the concepts learned in the session.

## Preparation for Next Session:
- Briefly introduce the next session's focus, which could delve deeper into deployment strategies, infrastructure as code, or monitoring and logging in a CI/CD context.
