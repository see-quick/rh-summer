# Session: Web Scraping and Storing Data

## Objective:
Learn to scrape weather data from a public source and store it in a database for future analysis.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Web Scraping Library:** BeautifulSoup for Python or Cheerio for Node.js, depending on the preferred programming language.
- **HTTP Requests:** Requests library for Python or Axios for Node.js to make HTTP requests.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing and managing scraped data. It's flexible and easy to use for beginners.
- **Development Environment:** Python or Node.js setup, MongoDB installation, and a code editor like VS Code.

## Mini-Lecture:

### 1. Introduction to Web Scraping:
   - Explain the concept of web scraping and its legal and ethical considerations.
   - Overview of HTML and CSS selectors, essential for extracting data from web pages.

### 2. Working with HTTP Requests:
   - Discuss how to make HTTP requests to retrieve web page content using Requests (Python) or Axios (Node.js).

### 3. Introduction to MongoDB:
   - Basic concepts of NoSQL databases and an introduction to MongoDB.
   - How to design a simple schema for storing weather data.

## Coding Activity:

### 1. Setting Up the Project:
   - Initialize a new project and install necessary libraries (e.g., BeautifulSoup/Cheerio, Requests/Axios).

### 2. Scraping Weather Data:
   - Choose a public weather website to scrape.
   - Write a script to make an HTTP request to the website and use BeautifulSoup or Cheerio to parse the HTML content.
   - Extract relevant weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions.

### 3. Storing Data in MongoDB:
   - Set up a MongoDB database and connect it to the project.
   - Design a simple schema for the weather data.
   - Store the scraped data in MongoDB.

## Wrap-Up and Discussion:

- **Review the session's work:** Discuss the challenges faced during scraping and storing data and how they were overcome.
- **Data Analysis Introduction:** Briefly introduce how the stored data can be analyzed in future sessions to gain insights.
- **Ethical Considerations:** Reinforce the importance of ethical web scraping practices, including respecting robots.txt files and rate limiting.

## Homework/Extension:

- **Enhance the Scraper:** Encourage adding functionality to scrape additional data, such as wind speed or air pressure.
- **Scheduled Scraping:** Implement functionality to automatically scrape weather data at scheduled intervals (e.g., daily).

## Preparation for Next Session:
Introduce the next session's focus on analyzing and visualizing the stored weather data to extract meaningful insights.
