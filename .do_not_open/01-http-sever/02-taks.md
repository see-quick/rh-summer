Certainly! Here are some structured tasks for students to complete, related to enhancing a basic HTTP server and using Spring Boot. These tasks will help reinforce their understanding through practical application:

### Tasks for Enhancing the Basic HTTP Server

#### Task 1: Modify the Server to Handle New Endpoints
- Add new endpoints to the server such as `/info` and `/help`.
- Implement GET handlers for these endpoints that return informative HTML content about the server and how to use it.

#### Task 2: Implement Error Handling
- Enhance the server to handle erroneous requests properly.
- Add a case to manage unknown paths and return a `404 Not Found` HTTP response.
- Implement a mechanism to handle exceptions gracefully, returning a `500 Internal Server Error` when unexpected errors occur.

#### Task 3: Enhance POST Request Handling
- Modify the `handlePostRequest` method to parse different types of data, such as form data or JSON.
- Add logging to POST requests to keep a record of incoming data for debugging purposes.

#### Task 4: Testing and Validation
- Test all endpoints using `curl` or Postman to ensure they handle requests as expected.
- Write a brief report documenting the testing process and any issues found.
